# EfficientDialogueNet

EfficientDialogueNet is a simple language model that combines shallow-deep network architecture with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient parameterization. This project aims to create a lightweight yet effective language model for basic conversational tasks.

## Features

- Shallow-deep attention mechanism
- LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning
- Simple training and inference scripts
- Customizable model and training configurations
